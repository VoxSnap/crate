Breaking Changes
================

Changes
=======

- Implemented a thread-utilization down-scaling logic which dynamically adapts
  the number of threads used for ``SELECT`` queries to avoid running into
  ``RejectedExcecution`` errors if there are many shards per node involved in
  the queries.

- Changed internals for DELETE and UPDATE queries which should generally result
  in a performance increase for queries which only match a subset of the rows
  and avoid ``CircuitBreakingException`` errors. But it might result in a
  slight performance decrease if the queries match all
  or almost all records.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue which could result in lost entries at the ``sys.jobs_log`` and
  ``sys.operations_log`` tables when the related settings are changed while
  entries are written.

- Fixed a dependecy issue with the bundled ``crash`` that caused the app not
  being able to connect to the server.

- Fixed an issue that could prevent postgres clients from receiving an error and
  therefore getting stuck.

- Fixed an issue that would cause a ``CAST`` from ``TIMESTAMP`` to ``LONG`` to
  be ignored.

- Handle ``STRING_ARRAY`` as argument type for user-defined functions correctly
  to prevent an ``ArrayStoreException``.
